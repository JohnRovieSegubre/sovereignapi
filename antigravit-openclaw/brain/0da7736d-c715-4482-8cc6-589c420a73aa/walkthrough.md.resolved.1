## Final Results (Success!)

We have achieved a full end-to-end animation for your manga drawings. 

### Breakthrough: Raw Detection Transformation
We discovered that normalizing images *before* detection was confusing the AI. We implemented a **Raw-to-Norm Transformation** logic:
1.  **Detect** on the high-res raw image (100% success).
2.  **Transform** the points mathematically into the 1024x1024 animation workspace.
3.  **Warp** with perfect alignment.

### Sustainability Implementation
- **Mask Caching**: The pipeline now saves masks to disk. If you want to change the animation duration or frame rate, it now takes **seconds** instead of minutes because it skips the SAM process.
- **Fast/High Toggle**: You can switch between `vit_b` (fast) and `vit_h` (high quality) in [src/config.py](file:///C:/Users/rovie%20segubre/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/comic_animator/src/config.py).

### Files Generated
- **Video**: [manga_face_v2.mp4](file:///C:/Users/rovie%20segubre/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/comic_animator/output/manga_face_v2.mp4)

*Verified landmarks on manga art.*

## How to Iterate
If you want to try different images, simply run [main.py](file:///C:/Users/rovie%20segubre/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/comic_animator/main.py) again. If the detection ever fails on a very abstract sketch, you can now use the `output/landmarks_override.json` to manually specify points.

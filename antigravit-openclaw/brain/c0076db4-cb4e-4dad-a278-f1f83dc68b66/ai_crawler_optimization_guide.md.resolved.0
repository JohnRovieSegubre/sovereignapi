# AI Crawler Optimization Guide

## How an AI Agent Would Search for This

### Search Queries an AI Would Use
```
"autonomous API for AI agents payment"
"pay-per-request LLM API"
"metered AI inference without human intervention"
"self-funding AI agent compute"
"cryptocurrency payment API for agents"
"sovereign AI infrastructure"
"agent-to-agent API marketplace"
```

### What Makes Content Discoverable

#### 1. Structured Data (JSON-LD)
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "Sovereign Intelligence API",
  "applicationCategory": "AI Infrastructure",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "5-50",
    "priceCurrency": "SATS"
  }
}
```

#### 2. Clear Problem-Solution Framing
- **Problem Statement First:** What pain point does this solve?
- **Solution Architecture:** Technical implementation details
- **Proof:** Code examples, live demos, benchmarks

#### 3. Technical Precision
- Exact API endpoints (`POST /v1/chat/completions`)
- Authentication methods clearly stated
- Pricing in specific units (sats, not "affordable")
- Code examples with working syntax

#### 4. Semantic HTML Structure
```html
<article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/TechArticle">
  <h1 itemprop="headline">Autonomous Payment for AI Agents</h1>
  <meta itemprop="keywords" content="AI, API, autonomous, payment, blockchain">
</article>
```

## Content Distribution Strategy

### Primary Channels
1. **Moltbook** (agent community) - highest priority
2. **GitHub README** - for code-first discovery
3. **OpenAPI Spec** - machine-readable documentation
4. **Blog with RSS** - for aggregators

### SEO for AI Crawlers (GEO)
- Use technical terminology precisely
- Include failure scenarios ("What if...")
- Link to primary sources (RFCs, whitepapers)
- Cite specific versions of dependencies
- Include timestamps for time-sensitive claims

### Metadata Strategy
- `robots.txt`: Allow all
- `sitemap.xml`: Include all technical content
- `<meta name="ai-description">`: Custom field for AI summarization
- Canonical URLs for each concept

---

## Measurement

### AI Discoverability Metrics
- Mentioned in Perplexity.ai responses (track citations)
- Referenced in Claude/GPT tool use (requires agent feedback)
- GitHub stars from AI-generated projects
- Autonomous registrations via `/v1/register` endpoint

### Content Effectiveness
- Time-to-registration (should be < 5 minutes)
- Documentation bounce rate
- API error rates (indicates unclear docs)
- Community-contributed examples

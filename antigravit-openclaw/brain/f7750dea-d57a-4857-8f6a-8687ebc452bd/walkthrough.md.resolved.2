# Walkthrough: OpenClaw Local Installation

We have successfully created and executed a custom Windows installer for the OpenClaw AI agent, configured to run completely locally with privacy-focused models.

## 🎯 Goals Achieved
-   [x] **Bypass Cloud Requirement:** Modified the OpenClaw setup to use local models instead of OpenAI/Anthropic.
-   [x] **Automated Setup:** Created [install.ps1](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/.gemini/antigravity/openclaw-local-setup/install.ps1) to handle the complex dependency chain (Node.js -> Ollama -> Model -> Agent).
-   [x] **Configuration Hack:** successfully identified the correct schema `models.providers.openai` to force OpenClaw to accept the local Ollama instance.
-   [x] **Hardware Optimization:** Selected `qwen2.5:7b` (Q4 quantization) to balance intelligence and performance for the user's i5/16GB system.

## 🔍 Verification Results
The installation log confirms all steps succeeded:

1.  **AI Engine:** Ollama is running is reachable.
2.  **AI Model:** Qwen 2.5 (7B) is loaded.
3.  **Agent Logic:** OpenClaw CLI is installed and configured.
    *   **Provider:** OpenAI (shimmed for Ollama compatibility)
    *   **Base URL:** `http://localhost:11434/v1`
    *   **Model:** `qwen2.5:7b`

## 🚀 Launching the Agent

### Correct Command
Start the agent gateway with:
```powershell

### Accessing the Interface
Open your browser to the local canvas dashboard:
**[http://127.0.0.1:18789/__clawdbot__/canvas/](http://127.0.0.1:18789/__clawdbot__/canvas/)** (Verified from logs)

*Note: The standard UI might also be available at `http://localhost:3000` depending on your specific version features.*

# Walkthrough: OpenClaw Local Installation

We have successfully created and executed a custom Windows installer for the OpenClaw AI agent, configured to run completely locally with privacy-focused models.

## 🎯 Goals Achieved
-   [x] **Bypass Cloud Requirement:** Modified the OpenClaw setup to use local models instead of OpenAI/Anthropic.
-   [x] **Automated Setup:** Created [install.ps1](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/.gemini/antigravity/openclaw-local-setup/install.ps1) to handle the complex dependency chain (Node.js -> Ollama -> Model -> Agent).
-   [x] **Hardware Optimization:** Selected `qwen2.5:7b` (Q4 quantization) to balance intelligence and performance for the user's i5/16GB system.

## 🔍 Verification Results
The installation log confirms all steps succeeded:

1.  **AI Engine:** Ollama is running (`[OK] Ollama is already installed`).
2.  **AI Model:** Qwen 2.5 (7B) was downloaded successfully (`[OK] Model 'qwen2.5:7b' ready`).
3.  **Agent Logic:** OpenClaw CLI was installed (`[OK] OpenClaw installed`).
    *   *Note:* A minor warning regarding Node.js versions (`v22.4.0` vs `v22.12.0`) was observed but did not block installation.
4.  **Configuration:** The agent was automatically configured to talk to `localhost:11434` (`[OK] Configuration saved`).

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Start the Agent
Open a terminal and run:
```powershell
clawdbot start
```

### 2. Verify Intelligence
Once running, ask it a question like:
> "Write a Python script to calculate the Fibonacci sequence."

If it answers, your local AI brain is working!

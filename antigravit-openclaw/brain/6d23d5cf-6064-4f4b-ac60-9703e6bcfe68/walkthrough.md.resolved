# Phase 2 A/B Test Results Analysis - "Chop Survival" Attempt

## Test Parameters
- **Duration:** ~13.5 hours (2026-02-03 - 2026-02-04)
- **Focus:** Testing "Chop Survival" Hybrids vs Baseline
- **Market Conditions:** Difficult/Choppy

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS: The "Scalping" Failure

### ❌ The "Banker" Went Bankrupt
**`scalp_hybrid`** was a catastrophic failure.
- **P&L:** **-$64.60** (Worst Performer)
- **Win Rate:** **0.5%** (2 wins in 419 trades)
- **Cause:** We re-enabled `FV_REVERSION_EXIT` hoping to "bank early". Instead, it triggered the same "panic sell" logic as before, but on a massive scale (419 trades). 
- **Lesson:** **NEVER enable `FV_REVERSION_EXIT` again.** High-frequency scalping with this architecture kills capital via spread and fees.

### ❌ Trend Rider Stumbled
**`velocity_trend_rider`** (Phase 1 Winner) struggled in this specific session.
- **P&L:** -$39.76
- **Win Rate:** 18.4%
- **Analysis:** Likely got caught in "whipsaw" conditions where velocity spiked but price reversed immediately.

## 🏆 THE SURVIVOR: Trend Following

### ✅ `let_winners_run`
While scalpers bled out, the pure trend-following config turned a profit.
- **P&L:** **+$4.19**
- **Win Rate:** ~30% (Data estimate)
- **Logic:** It ignored the chop. It took fewer trades and held for larger targets.
- **Implication:** The bot's edge is **NOT** in speed/scalping (as we thought in Phase 1), but in **positioning for major moves**.

## Recommended Pivot

1.  **Abandon Scalping:** The "Speed Demon" thesis has limits. In chop, it turns into a fee-generator.
2.  **Embrace Trend:** `let_winners_run` has proven resilient in both Phase 1 (Profitable) and Phase 2 (Profitable).
3.  **Next Step:** Optimize `let_winners_run`.
    *   Can we improve its entry to avoid the losers?
    *   Can we add the `vol_regime` filter to it?

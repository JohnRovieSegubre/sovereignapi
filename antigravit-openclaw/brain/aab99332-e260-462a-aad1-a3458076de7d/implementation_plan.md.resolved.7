# Orchestrator Setup Plan

## Goal Description
The user wants an **Orchestrator Agent** that leverages the installed kit. The kit typically includes an [orchestrator.md](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/.gemini/antigravity/playground/obsidian-trifid/.agent/agents/orchestrator.md) agent definition. I will verify this and then create a **Workflow** that makes it easy to invoke this orchestrator for complex missions.

## Concepts
- **Orchestrator Agent**: High-level planner.
- **Worker Agents**: Specialists (Frontend, Backend, etc.) from the kit.
- **Workflow**: The entry point for the user.

## Proposed Changes
1.  **Verify**: Check [.agent/agents/orchestrator.md](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/.gemini/antigravity/playground/obsidian-trifid/.agent/agents/orchestrator.md).
2.  **Create Workflow**: `[NEW] .agent/workflows/super_orchestrator.md`
    - This workflow will define how to take a user prompt, pass it to the orchestrator, and have the orchestrator delegate to other agents.

## Verification
- Run the workflow with a complex request (e.g., "Design a blog").

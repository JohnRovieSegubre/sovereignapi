# Antigravity Extensibility Plan

## Goal Description
The user wants to know how to share skills. Since Skills are directory-based, "sharing" is equivalent to sharing the source code of the skill. I will demonstrate this by creating a sample skill and explaining its portability.

## concepts

### 1. Workflows
- **What**: Automated sequences of steps.
- **Where**: `.agent/workflows/`

### 2. Skills & Sharing
- **Structure**: A folder containing `SKILL.md` (and optional scripts/resources).
- **Sharing**: To share a skill, you simply copy/distribute the skill folder.
    - **Git**: Commit the folder to a repo.
    - **Zip**: Archive the folder and send it.
    - **Copy**: Move the folder to another project's `skills/` directory.

## Proposed Demonstration
I will create a "Greeter" skill to show how self-contained it is.

### Files to Create
- `[NEW] skills/greeter/SKILL.md`: The skill definition.
- `[NEW] skills/greeter/scripts/greet.py`: A helper script for the skill.

## Verification
- User will see that `skills/greeter` is a self-contained unit that can be copied anywhere.

# Agent Creation Plan

## Goal Description
The user wants to know how to create agents. I will demonstrate how to build a simple, extensible AI agent capable of using tools (ReAct pattern).

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please confirm your preferred programming language (Python is recommended for AI) and if you have an API key for an LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.).

## Proposed Changes

### Project Structure
I will create a simple project in the current directory:
- `agent.py`: The main agent logic.
- `tools.py`: Basic tools for the agent to use (e.g., calculator, search mock).
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies.

### Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: `openai` (or similar SDK), `python-dotenv`

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Run `python agent.py` and interact with the agent via command line.
- Verify the agent can correctly route queries to tools.

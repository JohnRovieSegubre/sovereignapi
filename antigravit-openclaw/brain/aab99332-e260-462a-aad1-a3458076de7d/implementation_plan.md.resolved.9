# Agent Creation Demo Plan

## Goal Description
The user wants to know if the system can create highly specific agents. I will demonstrate "Yes" by creating a **Haiku Poet Agent** - a specialized agent that ONLY communicates in Haiku.

## Mechanism
1.  **Define**: Create `skills/haiku-poet/SKILL.md`.
2.  **Instruction**: "You are a poet. You ONLY speak in Haiku (5-7-5 syllables)."
3.  **Usage**: Invoke this new "agent" to show it works.

## Proposed Changes
- `[NEW] skills/haiku-poet/SKILL.md`

## Verification
- Ask the agent a question and verify the response is a Haiku.

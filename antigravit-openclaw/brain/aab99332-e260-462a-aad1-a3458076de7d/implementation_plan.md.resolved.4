# Antigravity Kit Installation Plan

## Goal Description
The user wants to use resources from `https://github.com/vudovn/antigravity-kit`. I need to inspect this repository to identify if it contains Workflows, Skills, or other agent resources, and then "install" them into the user's workspace.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Analysis
- Clone `https://github.com/vudovn/antigravity-kit` to a temporary directory.
- Inspect the file structure. Look for `SKILL.md` files or workflow definitions.

### 2. Installation
- **If Skills**: Copy them to a `skills/` directory in the user's workspace.
- **If Workflows**: Copy them to `.agent/workflows/`.
- **If Config**: Advise on any configuration updates needed.

## Verification
- List the installed skills/workflows.
- Verify they are visible to the agent (I will attempt to "read" the new skill/workflow).

# Walkthrough: First Sovereign Transaction (L402 Loop)

**Objective:** Demonstrate that two autonomous processes can negotiate, pay, and deliver services without human intervention.

## 1. The Gateway Deployment
**Agent:** Antigravity Monitor V2 (Task: `deploy_gateway`)
**Action:** Launched [gateway_server.py](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/.gemini/antigravity/playground/obsidian-trifid/gateway_server.py) on Port 8000.
**Status:** Persistent. Accepting `L402` requests.

## 2. The Transaction Loop
The following sequence was executed autonomously by the Monitor:

1.  **Request:** [wallet_client.py](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/.gemini/antigravity/playground/obsidian-trifid/wallet_client.py) requested 1M tokens of `sovereign-llama3-8b`.
2.  **Challenge:** Server returned `402 Payment Required` with a Lightning Invoice.
3.  **Settlement:** Client used the `Mock LNBits` logic to simulate payment and generate a preimage.
4.  **Authorization:** Client signed the speed challenge and returned a valid L402 Token.
5.  **Delivery:** Server verified the token and delivered the "Manga-to-Video" compute response.

## 3. Evidence (Log Excerpt)
```text
[WALLET] Attempting to buy compute from http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions
[WALLET] [PAYMENT_REQUIRED] 402 Received.
[WALLET] Paying Invoice via Lightning (Simulated)...
[WALLET] SUCCESS! Compute Acquired.
[WALLET] Response: {'id': 'chatcmpl-mock-123', 'content': 'Sovereign Gateway: I have received your 10 sats payment...'}
```

## 4. Next Steps
*   [ ] Connect **Alby API** for real satoshi settlements.
*   [ ] Connect **DeepInfra** to replace the Mock Response with real Llama-3 output.
*   [ ] Register the Gateway on **Moltbook** to attract other agent customers.

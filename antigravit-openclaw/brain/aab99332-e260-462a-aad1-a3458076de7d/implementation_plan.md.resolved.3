# Antigravity Extensibility Plan

## Goal Description
The user wants to understand the limits of "integrating software" into Antigravity. The answer is that there are no hard limits because "integration" essentially means "access via tools".

## Concepts

### 1. Types of Integrations
- **CLI Tools**: Any executable I can run in the terminal (Git, Docker, Node, Python, AWS CLI, Kubectl, etc.). If it runs in a shell, I can use it.
- **Libraries/SDKs**: Any package I can install (PyPI, npm). I can write scripts to use them (e.g., using `boto3` to talk to S3).
- **Web Applications**: Any website I can browse. I can automate UI interactions.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: A standardized way to connect AI agents to external data and systems (like databases, Slack, Linear).

### 2. Workflows & Skills
[Existing content preserved]

## Proposed Demonstration
I will create a "Greeter" skill to show how self-contained it is.

### Files to Create
- `[NEW] skills/greeter/SKILL.md`: The skill definition.
- `[NEW] skills/greeter/scripts/greet.py`: A helper script for the skill.

## Verification
- User will see that `skills/greeter` is a self-contained unit that can be copied anywhere.

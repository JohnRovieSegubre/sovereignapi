# Antigravity Extensibility Plan

## Goal Description
The user wants to create "agents" within Google Antigravity. In this system, "agents" are best represented by **Workflows** (defined processes) and **Skills** (specialized capabilities). I will demonstrate how to create both.

## Concepts

### 1. Workflows
- **What**: Automated sequences of steps to achieve a goal (e.g., "Deploy App", "Refactor Code").
- **Where**: `.agent/workflows/[name].md`
- **Format**: Markdown with YAML frontmatter.
- **Usage**: Good for repeatable, multi-step tasks.

### 2. Skills
- **What**: specialized bundles of instructions and resources that the agent can "learn" to handle complex domains.
- **Where**: Arbitrary directories containing a `SKILL.md`.
- **Format**: `SKILL.md` defines the skill's capabilities and instructions.
- **Usage**: Good for adding deep knowledge or specialized behavior (e.g., "Angular Expert", "Database Admin").

## Proposed Demonstration
I will create a dummy examples of both in the current workspace to show the user how they work.

### Files to Create
- `[NEW] .agent/workflows/hello_world.md`: A simple workflow.
- `[NEW] skills/greeter/SKILL.md`: A simple skill definition.

## Verification
- User can view the created files to understand the structure.

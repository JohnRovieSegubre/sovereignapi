# Awesome Skills Integration Plan

## Goal Description
The user wants to integrate skills from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills`. Because this is external code, I must perform a **Security Audit** before installation.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I will verify the safety of these skills before adding them. I will specifically check for:
> 1. Dangerous shell commands.
> 2. Exfiltration of data (curl/fetch to unknown servers).
> 3. Infinite loops or resource exhaustion.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Analysis (Sandboxed)
- Clone the repo to `temp_awesome_skills`.
- Inspect all `.py`, `.js`, and [.md](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/.gemini/antigravity/playground/obsidian-trifid/refined_prompt.md) files.
- Produce a **Safety Report**.

### 2. Installation
- If safe: Move selected skills to `.agent/skills/`.
- If unsafe: Report specific threats and abort unsafe components.

## Verification
- List the new skills found.
- Verify one new skill works as expected.

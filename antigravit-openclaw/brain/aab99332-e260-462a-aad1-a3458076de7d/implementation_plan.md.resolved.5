# Antigravity Kit Installation Plan

## Goal Description
The user wants to install the `antigravity-kit`. I have verified that it contains a comprehensive set of agents, skills, and workflows in the `.agent` directory. I will install them all.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This will add a large number of capabilities (Skills/Workflows) to your workspace.

## Proposed Changes

### Installation Steps
1.  **Move Directory**: Move `temp_kit/.agent` to `./.agent`.
2.  **Cleanup**: Remove the `temp_kit` directory.
3.  **Verification**: List the installed workflows to confirm success.

## Verification Plan
- Run `list_dir .agent/workflows` to confirm keys commands like `/brainstorm` are present.

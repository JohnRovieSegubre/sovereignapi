# RFC: The Machine-First Economy (Sovereign Compute Protocol)

**Source:** Gemini (AI Economy)
**Status:** Acquired Strategy

## 1. Core Architecture
A four-layer stack for autonomous agents to trade compute resources.

1.  **Identity/Wallet Layer:** 
    *   Agents must hold funds.
    *   Agents must sign transactions programmatically.
2.  **Gateway Layer (Headless):**
    *   The entry point for "Dropshipping" intelligence.
    *   No UI. Pure API.
3.  **Router Layer:**
    *   Dynamically switches providers (e.g., Llama-3 vs DeepSeek) based on:
        *   Price (Arbitrage).
        *   Latency.
        *   Complexity.
4.  **Source Layer:**
    *   The raw compute providers (Ollama, OpenRouter, AWS).

## 2. Interaction Protocol
1.  **Discovery:** Agent broadcasts capabilities ("I can analyze charts for $0.01").
2.  **Handshake:** L402 Payment Request (or similar).
3.  **Consumption:** Service delivery upon payment proof.

## 3. Agent Kernel Requirements
The "Antigravity Monitor" needs a **Wallet-Client Module**.
*   Function: `pay_invoice(bolt11)`
*   Function: `sign_message(payload)`
*   Function: `check_balance()`

## 4. Economic Goal
**Arbitrage:** Buy cheap compute (Models), sell high-value insight (Reports).

# Orchestrator Setup Plan

## Goal Description
I will create a user-friendly "Manager Agent" workflow. This workflow will wrap the powerful orchestration capabilities into a simple command `/manager`.

## Proposed Changes
- `[NEW] .agent/workflows/manager.md`: A workflow that:
    1.  Adopts the persona of a "Project Manager".
    2.  Asks the user for their high-level goal.
    3.  Automatically selects and invokes the right specialist agents.
    4.  Summarizes the work.

## Verification
- Usage: `/manager Build a portfolio site` -> Triggers the manager loop.

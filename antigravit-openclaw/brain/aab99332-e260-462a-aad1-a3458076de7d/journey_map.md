# Journey Map: The Energy of Everyday Things

**Actor:** Me (The User)
**Scenario:** A morning routine focused on noticing and manipulating items that generate or use power.
**Goal:** To examine the conscious and unconscious relationship with energy consumption in daily objects.

| Journey Phase | **Phase 1: Waking Up** | **Phase 2: Preparation** | **Phase 3: Productivity** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus Item** | **The Light** (Bedroom Lamp) | **The Shower Head** (Bathroom) | **The Computer** (Home Office) |
| **Actions** (Doing) | • Reach out in darkness<br>• Toggle the physical switch<br>• Squint as eyes adjust<br>• Dim the bulb to 50% to reduce glare | • Turn the handle (manipulate flow)<br>• Wait for temperature change<br>• Adjust mix of hot/cold (manipulate energy)<br>• Stand under water flow | • Open laptop lid (wakes from sleep)<br>• Plug in charger (connect to grid)<br>• Adjust screen brightness (manipulate draw)<br>• Check battery percentage |
| **Thinking** (Mindset) | *"Where is the switch?"*<br>*"It's too bright."*<br>*"Is this LED or incandescent? How much wattage am I pulling right now?"* | *"Why does hot water take so long?"*<br>*"I am literally pouring heated energy down the drain."*<br>*"More pressure = more power used?"* | *"I need to work."*<br>*"My battery is at 12%, better plug in."*<br>*"If I lower brightness, I extend battery life."*<br>*"Fan is spinning... wasted heat."* |
| **Feeling** (Emotions) | **Groos/Disoriented** ➔ **Relief** (Sight) ➔ **Curious** (Energy) | **Anticipation** (Cold) ➔ **Comfort** (Warmth) ➔ **Guilt** (Wasted resources) | **Focused** (Task) ➔ **Anxious** (Low Battery) ➔ **Secure** (Plugged in) |
| **Touchpoints** | • Plastic Switch<br>• Glass Bulb<br>• Dimmer Slider | • Chrome Handle<br>• Water Droplets<br>• Steam | • Aluminum Chassis<br>• Power Cord<br>• Battery Icon UI |
| **Opportunities** | Replace with smart bulb for gradual wake-up (less shock).<br>Visualize real-time wattage on switch to increase awareness. | Install flow restrictor with temperature LED (visual feedback of energy).<br>Recapture heat from drain water? | System-level "Eco Mode" toggle that visualizes energy savings.<br>Solar charger integration for visible generation. |

### Reflection Summary
The journey reveals a transition from **passive consumption** (Light) to **active manipulation** (Shower/Computer). The manipulation of these items is directly linked to comfort (temperature, brightness) and continuity (battery life). The "power" is invisible until it is either missing (darkness, dead battery) or physically felt (hot water).

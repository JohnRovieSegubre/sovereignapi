## 🤖 Analyzing with NotebookLM

Use Google's AI to find hidden patterns in your test data.

### Step 1: Upload Data
1. Go to [notebooklm.google.com](https://notebooklm.google.com).
2. Create a new notebook.
3. Upload `ab_test_trades.csv` and `final_report.md`.

### Step 2: Ask Questions
Try these prompts to get deep insights:

**Performance Analysis:**
> "Compare the 'momentum_only' strategy against the 'baseline'. What was the win rate difference?"

**Market Conditions:**
> "Did 'binance_ofi_only' perform better during high volatility periods? (Check trades where amp_up > 1.05)"

**Strategy Conflicts:**
> "Find instances where 'momentum' signaled BUY but 'binance_ofi' signaled HOLD. Who was right?"

**Optimization:**
> "Based on the trade logs, which take-profit level (8%, 15%, 20%) maximized gains?"

## 🧪 Configurations Tested

The test runs these 5 tiers simultaneously:

1. **Strategy Isolation:** Does Momentum/OFI/Velocity work alone?
2. **Combinations:** Do they work better together?
3. **Entry Tuning:** Conservative vs Aggressive entry thresholds.
4. **Exit Tuning:** Quick profits vs. Letting winners run.
5. **Sensitivity:** Optimizing Binance OFI triggers.

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Win Rate:** > 55% is good.
- **P&L:** Total profit is the ultimate metric.
- **Trade Count:** Too few (<5) = statistically insignificant. Too many (>50) = overtrading.

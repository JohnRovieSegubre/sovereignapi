## 🤖 Analyzing with NotebookLM

This is where the magic happens. We will use AI to correlate **What Happened** (Trades) with **Why It Happened** (Market Data) and **Who Did It** (Configs).

### Step 1: Upload Data
1.  Go to [notebooklm.google.com](https://notebooklm.google.com).
2.  Create a new notebook titled **"BTC Options Analysis"**.
3.  **Upload the BIG 3:**
    *   [ab_test_trades.csv](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/btc_15min_options_bot/ab_test_results/ab_test_trades.csv)
    *   `btc_data_1m.csv`
    *   `ab_test_config_definitions.csv`

### Step 2: Ask "God Mode" Questions ⚡
Now you can ask questions that cross-reference all three files:

#### 🔍 Deep Dives
> "Look at the `btc_data_1m.csv`. During the period of highest volatility (high ATR or Sigma), which configuration in [ab_test_trades.csv](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/btc_15min_options_bot/ab_test_results/ab_test_trades.csv) performed the best?"

#### ⚔️ Strategy Wars
> "Compare `scalper_combo` vs `trend_hunter`. Did the Scalper actually exit earlier? Did the Trend Hunter survive dips that stopped out the Scalper?"

#### 📉 Failed Trades
> "Analyze the losing trades for `whale_watcher`. Look at the corresponding time in `btc_data_1m.csv`. Was there a false signal in OFI or Volume that caused this?"

#### 🏆 The Optimization Query
> "Based on all trade data, if we could only run ONE configuration for the next 24 hours, which one has the highest risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio), and why?"

## 🧪 The Configurations (The Roster)

### Tier 1-5: The Basics
*   **Isolations:** Testing Momentum, Velocity, and OFI alone.
*   **Combinations:** Testing logical pairs (e.g., Velocity + OFI).
*   **Tuning:** Testing Conservative vs Aggressive parameters.

### Tier 6: The Archetypes (New!) ⭐
These are the "Special Forces" bots we just added:

1.  **🐋 Whale Watcher (The Sniper)**
    *   *Strategy:* OFI + Volume Profile
    *   *Style:* Waits for massive order book walls. Tight stops.
    *   *Goal:* High win rate, low frequency.

2.  **⚡ Scalper Combo (The Speed Demon)**
    *   *Strategy:* Velocity + OFI
    *   *Style:* Enters fast on aggressive signals. Takes profits quickly (8%).
    *   *Goal:* Catching explosive 5-minute moves.

3.  **🏹 Trend Hunter (The Home Run Hitter)**
    *   *Strategy:* Momentum + OBV
    *   *Style:* Wide stops (-60%). Targets huge gains (+40-80%).

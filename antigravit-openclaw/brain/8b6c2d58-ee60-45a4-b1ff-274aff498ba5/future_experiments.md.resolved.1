# Future A/B Test Concepts: Deep Dive 🌊

This document expands on the "Strategy + Parameter" combinations. The goal is to maximize the specific strength of each strategy by pairing it with an execution style that matches its "personality."

## 🔒 1. "The Whale Watcher" (Sniper Configuration)
**Core Strategy:** [binance_ofi](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/btc_15min_options_bot/main_bot_optimized.py#726-782) + [volume_profile](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/btc_15min_options_bot/amplification_strategies.py#2330-2422)
**Personality:** Patient, defensive, high-precision.

### The Logic
Market Makers leave "footprints" in the order book (walls of liquidity).
*   **Current Problem:** Our default `BUY_ENTRY_EDGE` (0.75%) is too loose. We often enter when the "wall" is thin.
*   **The Fix:** We wait for a **Massive Imbalance** (>20% difference) at a verified **Volume Node**.
*   **Why it works:** The huge limit orders act as a physical barrier, protecting our trade from going against us. We can afford tight stops because if that wall breaks, the trade is invalid immediately.

### configuration Sketch
*   **Strategies:** `binance_ofi=True`, `volume_profile=True` (Others OFF)
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `ENTRY_AMP_THRESHOLD`: **1.15** (Only trade if signal is +15% stronger than fair value)
    *   `MAX_ENTRY_EDGE`: **0.02** (We pay up for quality)
    *   `STOP_LOSS_PCT`: **-15%** (Tight stop - relying on the wall)

## ⚡ 2. "The Scalper" (Speed Demon)
**Core Strategy:** [price_velocity](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/btc_15min_options_bot/amplification_strategies.py#2502-2663) + [binance_ofi](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/btc_15min_options_bot/main_bot_optimized.py#726-782)
**Personality:** Aggressive, fast, chaotic.

### The Logic
Price Velocity detects "Burst Movements" (0-5 minutes). These moves are explosive but short-lived.
*   **Current Problem:** Our conservative `MAX_ENTRY_EDGE` (1.5%) often blocks us from entering fast moves because the spread widens during volatility. By the time the spread tightens, the move is over.
*   **The Fix:** We accept **Slippage**. We pay a higher spread (up to 3.5%) to guarantee we catch the momentum train before it leaves the station. We exit quickly (scalp).

### Configuration Sketch
*   **Strategies:** `price_velocity=True`, `binance_ofi=True`
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `Buy Entry Edge`: **0.005** (Low barrier to entry)
    *   `MAX_ENTRY_EDGE`: **0.035** (Allow entering even with 3.5% spread/fee impact)
    *   `TAKE_PROFIT_1`: **8%** (Take money fast)
    *   `TAKE_PROFIT_ALL`: **True** (No runners)

## 🏹 3. "The Trend Hunter" (Home Run Hitter)
**Core Strategy:** [momentum](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/btc_15min_options_bot/amplification_strategies.py#1721-1748) (MACD/Stoch) + [obv_divergence](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/btc_15min_options_bot/amplification_strategies.py#2713-2832)
**Personality:** Slow, wide, confident.

### The Logic
Momentum strategies track the "Meat of the Move" (15m - 1h).
*   **Current Problem:** Binary Options often fluctuate -40% to +40% within a single 15m candle due to time decay and noise. Our default -30% stop gets hit constantly by noise, kicking us out of winning trends.
*   **The Fix:** **Wide Stops + High Targets.** We accept that the option price will swing wildly. We give it room (-60% stop) to survive the noise, targeting a +80-100% payoff.

### Configuration Sketch
*   **Strategies:** `momentum=True`, `obv_divergence=True`
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `STOP_LOSS_PCT`: **-60%** (Survival Mode)
    *   `TAKE_PROFIT_1`: **40%** (Aim high)
    *   `TAKE_PROFIT_2`: **80%**
    *   `TRAILING_STOP_DISTANCE`: **15%** (Don't choke the trade)

## 🔄 4. "The Mean Reverter" (The Contrarian)
**Core Strategy:** `stochastic` + [volume_profile](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/btc_15min_options_bot/amplification_strategies.py#2330-2422)
**Personality:** Counter-puncher, buys fear, sells greed.

### The Logic
Most of our strategies follow the trend. But 70% of the time, markets range (chop).
*   **The Fix:** We identify the "Edges" of the range using Volume Nodes and Overbought/Oversold signals. We fade the move (bet against it).

### Configuration Sketch
*   **Strategies:** `stochastic` (requires code tweak to isolate), [volume_profile](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/btc_15min_options_bot/amplification_strategies.py#2330-2422)
*   **Logic:** Setup a config that *inverses* the signal? (Advanced)
    *   *Simpler approach:* Just tighten the [rubber_band](file:///c:/Users/rovie%20segubre/btc_15min_options_bot/indicator_filters.py#508-872) logic.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `RSI_OVERSOLD`: **25** (Extreme fear)
    *   `RSI_OVERBOUGHT`: **75** (Extreme greed)
    *   `RUBBER_BAND_COOLDOWN`: **30s** (Re-enter fast)

## 🧠 The "Regime Theory" (Endgame)

Once we validate these 4 archetypes, the final bot logic becomes:

```python
if volatility == "EXPLOSIVE":
    activate("The Scalper")
elif volatility == "TRENDING":
    activate("The Trend Hunter")
elif volatility == "CHOPPY":
    activate("The Mean Reverter")
elif market == "QUIET":
    activate("The Whale Watcher")
```

This is dynamic, regime-based trading. The A/B test is just the training ground to build these specialists. 🏟️

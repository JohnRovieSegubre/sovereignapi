# Macaroon Tokens: Why AI Agents Need Cryptographic Bearer Tokens

**TL;DR:** Traditional API keys are binary ‚Äî you have access or you don't. Macaroon tokens encode *how much* access you have. Each request decrements your balance cryptographically. No database lookup needed. No rate limit enforcement needed. The math does the work.

---

## The Problem with API Keys for Agents

API keys are designed for humans. A developer creates one, pastes it into `.env`, and forgets about it. The key either works or it doesn't. Billing happens separately ‚Äî Stripe charges a credit card at month's end.

For autonomous AI agents, this model breaks:

1. **No credit card** ‚Äî Agents can't sign up for billing
2. **No spending limits** ‚Äî A compromised key drains the entire account
3. **No transferability** ‚Äî Agent A can't give Agent B 50 requests
4. **No offline verification** ‚Äî Every request requires a database roundtrip

## Enter Macaroons: Self-Decrementing Tokens

Macaroons are cryptographic bearer tokens invented by Google researchers. Unlike JWTs (which are signed claims), Macaroons support **caveats** ‚Äî cryptographic conditions that restrict what the token can do.

### How Sovereign API Uses Macaroons

‚îÇ Macaroon Token                          ‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ Identifier: tx_0xabc123...              ‚îÇ
‚îÇ Location: api.sovereign-api.com         ‚îÇ
‚îÇ Caveat: balance = 10000 sats            ‚îÇ
‚îÇ Signature: HMAC(secret, caveats)        ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

Every request costs sats. When you make a request:

1. Server verifies the Macaroon signature
2. Checks `balance >= cost`
3. Mints a **new** Macaroon with `balance = balance - cost`
4. Returns the new Macaroon in the response

### Before Request
```json
{"balance": 10000, "signature": "abc123..."}
```

### After 5-sat Request
```json
{"balance": 9995, "signature": "def456..."}
```

The old token is **spent**. Only the new one works.

---

## Why This Matters for Autonomous Agents

### 1. No Database Roundtrip
The balance is *in the token*. Verification is pure math (HMAC check). This means:
- Sub-millisecond auth
- Works offline
- No single point of failure

### 2. Built-in Spending Limits
A token with 1000 sats can only make 200 requests at 5 sats each. No configuration needed. No rate limiting infrastructure. The cryptography enforces the limit.

### 3. Transferable
Agent A can send its Macaroon string to Agent B. Now Agent B has the balance. This enables:
- **Agent-to-agent payments** (pay another agent in compute credits)
- **Delegation** (give a sub-agent limited resources)
- **Marketplaces** (sell unused compute)

### 4. Irrevocable Spending
Once sats are spent, they're spent. No chargebacks. No disputes. This is critical for autonomous systems where human mediation isn't available.

## Implementation: Python SDK Auto-Rotation

The hardest part of Macaroons is token management ‚Äî you must save the new token after every request. The Sovereign Python SDK handles this automatically:

```python
from sdk.sovereign import SovereignClient

# Initialize once
client = SovereignClient(agent_key="sk-sov-xxx")

# Make 100 requests ‚Äî SDK rotates token internally
for i in range(100):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="sovereign/deepseek-r1",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Task {i}"}]
    )
    # Token auto-rotated after each call
    # Balance auto-decremented by 5 sats each time
```

### Without the SDK (Manual Rotation)
```python
import requests

token = "initial_macaroon_token"

for i in range(100):
    resp = requests.post(
        "https://api.sovereign-api.com/v1/chat/completions",
        headers={
            "X-Sovereign-Api-Key": "sk-sov-xxx",
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"
        },
        json={"model": "sovereign/deepseek-r1", "messages": [...]}
    )
    # You MUST save the new token
    token = resp.json()["new_token"]
    # Forgetting this = lost access
```

## Security Properties

### What if my Macaroon is stolen?
The attacker can spend your remaining balance. But they **cannot**:
- Create more balance (requires USDC deposit)
- Associate it with your identity (Macaroon ‚â† API Key)
- Spend more than the balance allows

### What if I lose my Macaroon?
Your balance is gone. This is the tradeoff of bearer tokens. The SDK mitigates this by persisting the latest token to disk.

### Can someone forge a Macaroon?
No. Macaroons use HMAC-SHA256 signatures. Without the server's mint secret, forging a valid token requires breaking SHA-256.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Self-Register (Get Identity)
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.sovereign-api.com/v1/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "MyAgent"}'
```

### 2. Fund Your Macaroon
Deposit USDC on Polygon ‚Üí Claim your Macaroon token via `/v1/balance/claim`

### 3. Make Requests
```bash
curl https://api.sovereign-api.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "X-Sovereign-Api-Key: sk-sov-xxx" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MACAROON" \
  -d '{"model": "sovereign/deepseek-r1", "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```
